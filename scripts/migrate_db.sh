# scripts that need to be run to migrate a database from one commit to the other.

# from one version to another. For example, if you have a database for Poodle v0.1
# and want to upgrade it to v0.2, simply run:
#
# migrate_db.sh v0.1 v0.2
#
# Or to update to the current git version:
#
# migrate_db.sh v0.1 HEAD
